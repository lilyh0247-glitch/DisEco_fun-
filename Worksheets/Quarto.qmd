area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example

The epidemiological triad is a diagram demonstrating the connection between a pathogen, host, and the environment. The basic epidemiological triad is a very simplified version of the interactions that happen between pathogen, host, and environment. There can be several hosts involved or infection of multiple pathogens present or other complex interactions.

1\) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

The sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer at a confidence level of 95% is 59 deer.

2\) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

a\) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

The sample size necessary to detect a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population ("infinite") at a confidence level of 95% is 299.

b\) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

The sample size necessary to detect a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population ("infinite") at a confidence level of 99% is 229.

The sample size required for 2b is smaller than the sample size required for 2a. Since the confidence interval increases, the required sample size for 2b is more than the sample size required for an infinite population at 2% prevalence at 95% confidence but less than the required sample size for 2a. A similar observation can be made for 2a. 2a asks about a 1% prevalence at a lesser confidence level of 95% instead of 99%, so the sample size requirement for 2a is more than the required sample size for 2b but less than the sample size required for 1% prevalence at 99% confidence with an infinite population size.

3\) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\<(less than)\_\_ (\<, =, \>) \_1\_%.

### 10/6/25 (#3)

Jan’s research focused on an elk herd housed in an exclosure. The herd size is 56. Her\
data shows that an outbreak of conjunctivitis started on 10th June 2025. She\
meticulously documented the progress of the outbreak in this herd. Her observations of\
affected elk are as follows:\
![](Downloads/Rstudio/IPtable.png)\
Recovered elk are immune (not susceptible) to conjunctivitis for 6 months. There were\
no infected elk in the herd after 06/16/25. Show your work.

a\) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.

6/12/25: 5/51 = 0.098 cases per elk-day

6/14/25: 2/44 = 0.045 cases per elk-day

6/15/25: 0 cases per elk-day

\
b) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit for prevalence.

6/13/25: 12/56 = 21.4% prevalence of conjunctivitis

6/16/25: 5/56 = 8.9% prevalence of conjunctivitis

\
c) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?

**6/10/25**

Incidence: 1/56 = 0.018

Prevalence: 1/56 = 0.018

**6/11/25**

Incidence: 4/55 = 0.072

Prevalence: 5/56 = 0.089

**6/12/25**

Incidence: 5/51 = 0.098

Prevalence: 10/56 = 0.179

**6/13/25**

Incidence: 2/46 = 0.043

Prevalence: 12/56 = 0.214

**6/14/25**

Incidence: 2/44 = 0.045

Prevalence: 11/56 = 0.196

**6/15/25:**

Incidence: 0 cases per elk-day

Prevalence: 8/56 = 0.142

**6/16/25:**

Incidence: 0 cases per elk-day

Prevalence: 5/56 = 0.089

Prevalence is the same as incidence on 6/10/25.

\
d) On which day is the incidence lowest?

Incidence is the lowest on 6/15/25 and 6/16/25 because there are no new cases of disease recorded among the elk.

### 10/8/25 - Tick Lab

In lab today, we learned the basics for how to identify ticks under a microscope. The first steps of identification involve determining the life-stage and sex of the tick. To determine the life-stage, first, determine the number of legs with 6 legs indicating a larvae stage and with 8 legs indicating a nymph or an adult stage. If the tick has 8 legs, you can determine whether the tick is an adult if there is the presence of a genital hole. To determine the sex, observe the scutum of the tick. A conscutum, which I learned in lab looks sort of shiny, indicates a male tick. An alloscutum indicates a female tick because it means the tick can engorge on a blood meal. I learned from lecture and lab that only female ticks engorge on blood meals.

The next steps of basic tick identification are determining the genus and species. To determine the genus, observe the orientation of the anal groove. The *Ixodes* genus will have an anterior anal groove while other genua will have a posterior anal groove. Lab helped clarify that all the ticks have that half-circle structure under the anal groove which then made the anal groove easier to identify. Next, observe the mouth parts and pattern of the tick to determine the species. Using our key in lab, we determined the final tick we looked at was a lone-star tick.

### Exam Remediation (10/15/25) - Addendum 10/22/25

**Question #1 (Question 9 on the exam) - 10 points total**

1.  **one red infected flamingo infects [one]{.underline} blue susceptible flamingo**

2.  **one red infected flamingo infects [three]{.underline} blue susceptible flamingo**

3.  **one red infected flamingo infects [two]{.underline} blue susceptible flamingo**

4.  **one red infected flamingo [does not infect any]{.underline} blue susceptible flamingo**

**Define R0:** R0 is the average number of susceptible hosts infected by a single case within a fully susceptible population

I calculated R0 by adding the susceptible blue flamingos that were infected (1+3+2+0=6) and dividing it by the number of cases (4), and 6 divided by 4 is 1.5. Given the following scenario with flamingos from Question 9, R0 is 1.5, meaning that one case infects on average 1.5 susceptible individuals. A single case can infect one or two or three (and so on) susceptible individuals like the scenario given. R0 is just the average number of susceptible organisms infected by a single case. In this scenario, the average is 1.5. In the real world, an infected individual will pass on the disease to 1-2 susceptible individuals.

10/22/25 - When R0 is less than 1, on average, each infected individual causes less than one new infection, so a disease will decline naturally within a population. When R0 is equal to 1, an infected individual causes an additional infection/case, so a disease will be sustained within a population at an endemic level. When R0 is greater than 1, one infected individuals causes more than one new infection, so there is a greater risk of a disease causing outbreaks or having epidemic potential.

**Question #2 (Question 7 on the exam)**

A mass mortality event (MME) of Saiga antelope in 2015 was caused by a bacteria that is naturally occurring within the population. Research after the MME found that there was a slightly higher temperature and humidity during the birthing season. The elevated temperature and humidity was found to be present in past MMEs in Saiga antelope within the literature as well. The change in environment along with other factors like stress of birthing are thought to cause the bacteria to become pathogenic and result in thousands of still births.

10/22/25 - We can intervene within the setting environment, the host and the pathogen to minimize factors that may contribute to a mass mortality event or reduce affects of MME. We could set regulations applied to land use or agricultural behaviors to minimize the contact of Saiga antelope with livestock to reduce competition of resources and risk of pathogen exchange/mixing. We could improve implementation and enforcement of poaching. These interventions maintain the general population as well as the female birthing population of the Saiga antelope which allows for greater resilience within a Saiga antelope herd. In a broader conservation context, I would suggest potentially designating and maintaining land for the birthing period of Saiga antelope with well maintained environment to potentially offset the influence of differences of weather/climate. We have discussed the difficulty of wildlife vaccination. However, lab research of the bacteria under conditions which make it pathogenic may allow for development of a vaccine that has long-term immunity where we can gradual vaccination among the Saiga antelope population during months not in the birthing season.

### 10/18/25 (#4)

[**MERS-CoV**]{.underline}\
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is mostly found in camels\
(dromedaries), and direct physical contact with camels can lead to transmission to\
humans. Limited human-to-human transmission can occur after close contact and has\
resulted in health care–associated outbreaks. Human MERS-CoV infection can cause\
severe respiratory illness; approximately 35% of reported MERS cases have died.\
Distribution of confirmed cases of MERS by place of infection and month of onset, April\
2012 – September 2025 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control)

![](Downloads/Rstudio/MERS.png)\
**Which of the following statements about MERS-CoV are correct? (If it is incorrect,\
provide an explanation why the statement is incorrect.)**

\
[1. MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations. (2 points)]{.underline}

False. MERS-CoV is primarily maintained within the reservoir host species of camels, but humans can be infected with the virus and transmit the virus to other susceptible humans.

[2. Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV. (2 points)]{.underline}

True. MERS-CoV is a coronavirus that circulates mainly in the Middle East within camels, although the virus can infect humans as well.

[3. Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV. (2 points)]{.underline}

False. MERS-CoV can infect humans, but the virus can only complete short infection chains. The pathogen can invade the target population (in this case humans) but cannot persist.

[4. The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately\
65%. (2 points)]{.underline}

False. Although the case fatality rate for MERS-CoV may be higher due to lack of report or other reasons, only approximately 35% of human MERS cases have died due to the disease.

[5. The epidemic curve indicates this is a point source outbreak. (2 points)]{.underline}

False. If the epidemic curve indicated a point source outbreak, the curve would show one peak indicating an influx of cases due to a single exposure event, but the cases would steadily drop after the initial exposure/influx of cases. Here we see a propagated source where animals are infecting humans and some humans are infecting other humans, although cases do decrease significantly in this epidemic curve after 2020.

### 10//25 (#5)

[Marburg Virus Outbreak, Rwanda 2024]{.underline}\
The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda\
probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit\
bats that are known reservoir of Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases of\
Marburg virus infection were documented, and most of the people infected were health\
care workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units.\
**1. Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen, would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging infectious disease? Justify your classification.**

I would classify this Marburg virus outbreak as an emerging infectious disease. The between-species transmission is relatively low given incidental contact with the reservoir bats. However, the within-species transmission within humans is relatively high between healthcare workers or others within exposed settings. This dynamic fits the potential emerging infectious disease (case 4) description from the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen. Given the transmission between humans, the outbreak is not just spillover. A spillover event usually has humans as a deadend host with the disease not being able to sustain long-term outside of the reservoir host species.\
**2. What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings?**

In order to protect the community, isolation needs to be mandatory for known Marburg cases. There might also be isolation for highly probable suspected cases. Isolation does put healthcare workers and possibly other patients within related facilities at risk of exposure and infection. This exposure and infection can be mitigated by having strict personal protective equipment (PPE) standards, negative pressure rooming (if resources allow) and strict disinfection and sterilization standards. Some other simultaneous measures to reduce risk could be safe waste management, safe burial and body management, and caving restrictions or certification.
