The epidemiological triad is a diagram demonstrating the connection between a pathogen, host, and the environment. The basic epidemiological triad is a very simplified version of the interactions that happen between pathogen, host, and environment. There can be several hosts involved or infection of multiple pathogens present or other complex interactions.

### **Worksheet** #2 (9/19/25)

![](Downloads/Rstudio/ss_table.png)

1\) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

The sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer at a confidence level of 95% is 59 deer.

2\) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

a\) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

The sample size necessary to detect a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population ("infinite") at a confidence level of 95% is 299.

b\) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

The sample size necessary to detect a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population ("infinite") at a confidence level of 99% is 229.

The sample size required for 2b is smaller than the sample size required for 2a. Since the confidence interval increases, the required sample size for 2b is more than the sample size required for an infinite population at 2% prevalence at 95% confidence but less than the required sample size for 2a. A similar observation can be made for 2a. 2a asks about a 1% prevalence at a lesser confidence level of 95% instead of 99%, so the sample size requirement for 2a is more than the required sample size for 2b but less than the sample size required for 1% prevalence at 99% confidence with an infinite population size.

3\) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\<(less than)\_\_ (\<, =, \>) \_1\_%.

### **Worksheet** #3 (10/6/25)

Jan’s research focused on an elk herd housed in an exclosure. The herd size is 56. Her\
data shows that an outbreak of conjunctivitis started on 10th June 2025. She\
meticulously documented the progress of the outbreak in this herd. Her observations of\
affected elk are as follows:\
![](Downloads/Rstudio/IPtable.png)\
Recovered elk are immune (not susceptible) to conjunctivitis for 6 months. There were\
no infected elk in the herd after 06/16/25. Show your work.

a\) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.

6/12/25: 5/51 = 0.098 cases per elk-day

6/14/25: 2/44 = 0.045 cases per elk-day

6/15/25: 0 cases per elk-day

\
b) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit for prevalence.

6/13/25: 12/56 = 21.4% prevalence of conjunctivitis

6/16/25: 5/56 = 8.9% prevalence of conjunctivitis

\
c) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?

**6/10/25**

Incidence: 1/56 = 0.018

Prevalence: 1/56 = 0.018

**6/11/25**

Incidence: 4/55 = 0.072

Prevalence: 5/56 = 0.089

**6/12/25**

Incidence: 5/51 = 0.098

Prevalence: 10/56 = 0.179

**6/13/25**

Incidence: 2/46 = 0.043

Prevalence: 12/56 = 0.214

**6/14/25**

Incidence: 2/44 = 0.045

Prevalence: 11/56 = 0.196

**6/15/25:**

Incidence: 0 cases per elk-day

Prevalence: 8/56 = 0.142

**6/16/25:**

Incidence: 0 cases per elk-day

Prevalence: 5/56 = 0.089

Prevalence is the same as incidence on 6/10/25.

\
d) On which day is the incidence lowest?

Incidence is the lowest on 6/15/25 and 6/16/25 because there are no new cases of disease recorded among the elk.

### Tick Lab (10/8/25)

In lab today, we learned the basics for how to identify ticks under a microscope. The first steps of identification involve determining the life-stage and sex of the tick. To determine the life-stage, first, determine the number of legs with 6 legs indicating a larvae stage and with 8 legs indicating a nymph or an adult stage. If the tick has 8 legs, you can determine whether the tick is an adult if there is the presence of a genital hole. To determine the sex, observe the scutum of the tick. A conscutum, which I learned in lab looks sort of shiny, indicates a male tick. An alloscutum indicates a female tick because it means the tick can engorge on a blood meal. I learned from lecture and lab that only female ticks engorge on blood meals.

The next steps of basic tick identification are determining the genus and species. To determine the genus, observe the orientation of the anal groove. The *Ixodes* genus will have an anterior anal groove while other genua will have a posterior anal groove. Lab helped clarify that all the ticks have that half-circle structure under the anal groove which then made the anal groove easier to identify. Next, observe the mouth parts and pattern of the tick to determine the species. Using our key in lab, we determined the final tick we looked at was a lone-star tick.

### Exam Remediation (10/15/25) - Addendum (10/22/25)

**Question #1 (Question 9 on the exam) - 10 points total**

1.  **one red infected flamingo infects [one]{.underline} blue susceptible flamingo**

2.  **one red infected flamingo infects [three]{.underline} blue susceptible flamingo**

3.  **one red infected flamingo infects [two]{.underline} blue susceptible flamingo**

4.  **one red infected flamingo [does not infect any]{.underline} blue susceptible flamingo**

**Define R0:** R0 is the average number of susceptible hosts infected by a single case within a fully susceptible population

I calculated R0 by adding the susceptible blue flamingos that were infected (1+3+2+0=6) and dividing it by the number of cases (4), and 6 divided by 4 is 1.5. Given the following scenario with flamingos from Question 9, R0 is 1.5, meaning that one case infects on average 1.5 susceptible individuals. A single case can infect one or two or three (and so on) susceptible individuals like the scenario given. R0 is just the average number of susceptible organisms infected by a single case. In this scenario, the average is 1.5. In the real world, an infected individual will pass on the disease to 1-2 susceptible individuals.

10/22/25 - When R0 is less than 1, on average, each infected individual causes less than one new infection, so a disease will decline naturally within a population. When R0 is equal to 1, an infected individual causes an additional infection/case, so a disease will be sustained within a population at an endemic level. When R0 is greater than 1, one infected individuals causes more than one new infection, so there is a greater risk of a disease causing outbreaks or having epidemic potential.

**Question #2 (Question 7 on the exam)**

A mass mortality event (MME) of Saiga antelope in 2015 was caused by a bacteria that is naturally occurring within the population. Research after the MME found that there was a slightly higher temperature and humidity during the birthing season. The elevated temperature and humidity was found to be present in past MMEs in Saiga antelope within the literature as well. The change in environment along with other factors like stress of birthing are thought to cause the bacteria to become pathogenic and result in thousands of still births.

10/22/25 - We can intervene within the setting environment, the host and the pathogen to minimize factors that may contribute to a mass mortality event or reduce affects of MME. We could set regulations applied to land use or agricultural behaviors to minimize the contact of Saiga antelope with livestock to reduce competition of resources and risk of pathogen exchange/mixing. We could improve implementation and enforcement of poaching. These interventions maintain the general population as well as the female birthing population of the Saiga antelope which allows for greater resilience within a Saiga antelope herd. In a broader conservation context, I would suggest potentially designating and maintaining land for the birthing period of Saiga antelope with well maintained environment to potentially offset the influence of differences of weather/climate. We have discussed the difficulty of wildlife vaccination. However, lab research of the bacteria under conditions which make it pathogenic may allow for development of a vaccine that has long-term immunity where we can gradual vaccination among the Saiga antelope population during months not in the birthing season.

### **Worksheet** #4 (10/18/25)

[**MERS-CoV**]{.underline}\
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is mostly found in camels\
(dromedaries), and direct physical contact with camels can lead to transmission to\
humans. Limited human-to-human transmission can occur after close contact and has\
resulted in health care–associated outbreaks. Human MERS-CoV infection can cause\
severe respiratory illness; approximately 35% of reported MERS cases have died.\
Distribution of confirmed cases of MERS by place of infection and month of onset, April\
2012 – September 2025 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control)

![](Downloads/Rstudio/MERS.png)\
**Which of the following statements about MERS-CoV are correct? (If it is incorrect,\
provide an explanation why the statement is incorrect.)**

\
[1. MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations. (2 points)]{.underline}

False. MERS-CoV is primarily maintained within the reservoir host species of camels, but humans can be infected with the virus and transmit the virus to other susceptible humans.

[2. Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV. (2 points)]{.underline}

True. MERS-CoV is a coronavirus that circulates mainly in the Middle East within camels, although the virus can infect humans as well.

[3. Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV. (2 points)]{.underline}

False. MERS-CoV can infect humans, but the virus can only complete short infection chains. The pathogen can invade the target population (in this case humans) but cannot persist.

[4. The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately\
65%. (2 points)]{.underline}

False. Although the case fatality rate for MERS-CoV may be higher due to lack of report or other reasons, only approximately 35% of human MERS cases have died due to the disease.

[5. The epidemic curve indicates this is a point source outbreak. (2 points)]{.underline}

False. If the epidemic curve indicated a point source outbreak, the curve would show one peak indicating an influx of cases due to a single exposure event, but the cases would steadily drop after the initial exposure/influx of cases. Here we see a propagated source where animals are infecting humans and some humans are infecting other humans, although cases do decrease significantly in this epidemic curve after 2020.

### **Worksheet** #5 (10/29/25)

[Marburg Virus Outbreak, Rwanda 2024]{.underline}\
The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda\
probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit\
bats that are known reservoir of Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases of\
Marburg virus infection were documented, and most of the people infected were health\
care workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units.\
**1. Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen, would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging infectious disease? Justify your classification.**

I would classify this Marburg virus outbreak as an emerging infectious disease. The between-species transmission is relatively low given incidental contact with the reservoir bats. However, the within-species transmission within humans is relatively high between healthcare workers or others within exposed settings. This dynamic fits the potential emerging infectious disease (case 4) description from the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen. Given the transmission between humans, the outbreak is not just spillover. A spillover event usually has humans as a deadend host with the disease not being able to sustain long-term outside of the reservoir host species.\
**2. What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings?**

In order to protect the community, isolation needs to be mandatory for known Marburg cases. There might also be isolation for highly probable suspected cases. Isolation does put healthcare workers and possibly other patients within related facilities at risk of exposure and infection. This exposure and infection can be mitigated by having strict personal protective equipment (PPE) standards, negative pressure rooming (if resources allow) and strict disinfection and sterilization standards. Some other simultaneous measures to reduce risk could be safe waste management, safe burial and body management, and caving restrictions or certification.

### **Worksheet** #7 (11/14/15)

[**Nipah Virus**]{.underline}\
Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission\
in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how the modes of transmission differ\
between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventive\
measures recommended in each setting. (8 points)

Nipah virus ecology varies across Southeast and South Asia. For example, Nipah virus is mainly transmitted through pig bridge hosts in Malaysia. Pigs will get Nipah virus from bats or fruit contaminated with bat excretions, and humans mainly get the virus from infected pigs in Malaysia. However, humans often get infected with Nipah virus through contaminated date palm sap in Bangladesh. Buckets collecting sap will become contaminated with bat excretions, and humans become infected from consuming raw sap.

These differences in transmission call for different preventative measures. Since most of the cases in Malaysia are from contact with infected pigs, early detection and surveillance of the disease is a possible preventative measure that is plausible with the route of transmission observed. In Bangladesh, there are a few more preventative options. Many infections come from consuming raw sap, so heating/cooking the sap prior to consumption is a precautionary action in addition to just avoiding raw date palm sap. There are also some covers or lids being used with some sap collection which prevents bat excretions from entering the sap during collection.

\
[**Avian Reovirus**]{.underline}\
Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the\
different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its\
transmission. What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes?\
Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly describe\
its impact on the affected population. (6 points)

Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted horizontally through fecal-oral transmission or vertically from the mother. Most cases are thought to be a result from fecal-oral transmission often as a consequence of vertical transmission. For example, a congenitally infected chick spreads the disease within a flock through the fecal-oral route. Fecal-oral transmission is enabled by poor hygiene, overcrowding, and poor ventilation. The pathogen itself is also resilient and persistent for weeks within the environment or on surfaces which further supports fecal-oral transmission.

ARV causes arthritis and tenosynovitis (swollen tendon) in commercial chickens and wild birds. These diseases cause lameness and swollen joints. In wild bird populations, these illnesses caused by ARV decrease the ability to or prevent escape from predators or foraging for food. Predation on sick wild birds can result in death, but illness in commercial chickens can also result in death based on decisions of product value and treatment costs.

\
[**Langya henipavirus**]{.underline}\
Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China.\
Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV\
classified as a spillover and not a potential EID? (6 points)

Based on some surveillance testing of wildlife within the Shandong and Henan provinces where cases were observed, the likely reservoir for LayV is shrews. Most of the cases were farmers or had frequent wildlife exposure, and shrews are widely present in these rural areas in China. LayV is thought to be transmitted through direct or indirect contact with shrews and their bodily fluids.

LayV is not classified as a potential emerging infectious (EID) disease because the virus does not have confirmed human-to-human transmission. A potential EID has the ability to infect another species, namely humans, and sustain infection within that population/humans. There have not been additional cases since the outbreak from 2018-2022. LayV is a spillover because the disease can infect other species (humans) besides the reservoir species, but the virus has not proven to sustain itself within the other species. (see Fenton and Pedersen community epidemiology framework)

### **Worksheet** #8 (11/18/25)

Overall, there is a significant difference between prevalence of raccoon roundworm in the three regions. When analyzed comparatively in pairs, there is a significant difference in the prevalence between the central region and north region (p-value=0.0256) as well as the central region and south region (p-value=0.0015), but there is not a significant difference just comparing the north and south (p-value=1). Regional differences suggest that there could be regional variation of raccoon density or environmental prescence and persistence of raccoon roundworm eggs. The central and south regions may have more or better established raccoon latrines.

When comparing sex of the raccoons, there was a significant difference between the prevalence of raccoon roundworm in females compared to males (p-value=0.0087). When comparing males and females in each region, the prevalence within females was only significant in the south region (p-value=0.0030); however, the data is potentially suggestive of a difference between females and males in the central region with a p-value of 0.0859. Greater prevalence within females may suggest social or reproductive behavioral differences that put females in greater contact with contaminated environments or raccoon latrines. There may also be physiological factors at play like reproductive stress.

There was not a significant difference for prevalence of raccoon roundworm in adults compared to young adults (p-value=0.2206). Also, there was no significant difference observed for the prevalence of raccoon roundworm between age classes within each region. The regional and sexual differences observed call for more research into the ecological, population, and geographic differences that may be driving these differences. The south region may need the most immediate attention because the region seems to pose the most environmental risk to children, domestic animals, and other wildlife based on the data.

### **Worksheet** #9 (11/22/25)

-   In 2024, a multistate Salmonella outbreak was linked to backyard poultry flocks in\
    the United States. What specific human behaviors contributed to the zoonotic\
    spread of Salmonella? In your response, identify at least three practices by backyard\
    poultry owners that increased the risk of Salmonella transmission, and briefly explain\
    why these behaviors facilitated human infection. 10 points

    Backyard poultry owners have more a more pet-like relationship with their flocks than commercial poultry owners. Backyard poultry owners have increased direct contact from directly handling the birds or from cuddling/playing with the birds as pets. Direct contact is one of the ways that bacteria like Salmonella enterica can be contracted, so increased direct contact increases the risk for infection.

    Backyard poultry owners often allow children to handle poultry, sometimes unsupervised. Increased direct contact is also true for kids. Kids will play with the birds and are more likely to put there hand in their mouth or something without washing their hands. Direct contact with the birds puts exposed kids at a higher risk of infection because kids, especially those under 5 years old, have weaker immune systems.

    Backyard poultry owners tend to have less strict biosecurity measures, inconsistent hygiene measures, and non-standardized management of litter and waste. One method of transmission is indirect contact. These practices put owners, children, and neighbors at risk because there is a higher risk of bacteria being present on fomites (e.g. boots, cleaning tools, etc.) and infecting individuals that come in contact with those items. When pathogens are shed into the litter, there is also a chance that particles get aerosolized when the litter is disturbed. There may also be transmission through direct contact with bacteria ridden eggs when there is poor hygiene conditions.

    Sometimes backyard poultry owners allow free range for their flocks. This can cause increased exposure and infection because Salmonella enterica can persist in the environment. The poor management previously discussed in addition to free range movement leads to shedding into the environment where soil or water bodies can become sources of exposure and infection to owners and surrounding individuals as well.

-   Tall fescue grass is commonly infected with a fungal endophyte (Epichloë\
    coenophiala) that produces ergot alkaloids associated with fescue toxicosis in\
    grazing livestock.

    -   What advantage does Tall fescue gain from being infected with a fungal\
        endophyte? 3 points

        Tall fescue grass is more durable and tolerant in stressful conditions when infected with the fungal endophyte. Tall fescue is more resistant to drought and overgrazing with the fungal endophyte, and we saw from picture in the presentation that infected grass appears greener and in better condition than non-infected grass.

    -   What environmental and ecological factors drive the occurrence and severity of\
        fescue toxicosis in grazing systems? 4 points

        Epichloë coenophiala naturally produces ergot alkaloids, but the fungus has increased production under stressful conditions. Stressors include hot or cold temperatures, drought, overgrazing, and limited soil nutrients. The microbiome in the soil and around tall fescue can also put stress on the plant and fungus whether through competition for soil nutrients or through other unknown mechanisms. Under these stressful conditions the fungus produces more ergot alkaloids which build up within the grass and increases the toxicity of the grass for livestock that are grazing.

    -   What are the key clinical signs of fescue toxicity in cattle? 3 points

        Ergot alkaloids produced by Epichloë coenophiala can cause weight loss, rough/discolored hair coats, reduced milk production, cardiovascular toxicity, and generally poor performance in cattle grazing on infected grass.

### **Worksheet** #10 (11/22/25)

-   What are the different routes of transmission for African Swine fever? What role do\
    humans play in the spread and transmission of ASF? 10 points

    African Swine Fever (ASF) can be transmitted through a biological vector (soft ticks), direct contact (pig-to-pig through blood, saliva, or feces), and indirect contact. The virus has environmental persistence which can last months in carcasses and pork products. Humans play a role in indirect transmission by acting as mechanical vectors. Humans transport contaminated material (e.g. equipment, clothes, etc.) between barns which spreads the virus. The expansion of agriculture and pig farming as well as landscape fragmentation increases wildlife contact with domestic pigs. Poor biosecurity, contaminated feeds, and illegal meat trade are other ways humans spread the virus across farms and borders.

-   Describe how co-infection with Koala retrovirus (KoRV) affects the severity,\
    progression, and management of Chlamydia in koalas. 10 points

    The Koala retrovirus (KoRV) is similar to the human retrovirus HIV as it is an acquired immunodeficiency virus. As KoRV suppresses the immune system, a Koala is more at risk of chlamydia infection and multiple infections. Symptoms of chlamydia (i.e. conjunctival, urinary, and respiratory dieases) are also worse for Koalas with co-infections of KoRV and chlamydia because their immune system is suppressed. More severe symptoms and multiple or continuous chlamydia infection progresses into infertility and mortality. Co-infection can impact the management of the species and efforts to increase the population as it increases infertility and mortality rates of Koalas. Co-infection may also affect the treatment of chlamydia because the suppressed immune system may not be suitable for use of antibiotics or the new vaccine available.

-   Snake Fungal Disease (SFD), caused by Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola, is an emerging\
    threat to wild snake populations in North America.

    -   What are the key challenges associated with the surveillance and management of\
        Snake Fungal Disease (SFD)? 10 points

        There are a few key ecological challenges to surveillance and management of Snake Fungal Disease (SFD). One challenge is the accuracy of testing. qPCR is used to test DNA for the presence of the fungus, but there are often false negatives when the presence is low for a specific snake. For example, a snake may be swabbed 5 times with only 1 positive result, so you can imagine a false negative had the area that resulted positive not been swabbed.

        There is also a seasonality of the disease due to snake brumation where testing is difficult because snake activity is low and management is difficult because of lowered immune systems. Wild snake populations are a challenge themselves because wild populations are difficult to sample. The environmental persistence of the fungal spores in soil makes the disease incredibly hard to manage as the spores are difficult to destroy and most snakes travel mostly by land. The spores also get spread and transmitted with humans acting as a mechanical vector because snakes come in contact with boots, equipment, etc. that is contaminated by soil with spores

### Final Exam (12/3/25)

Lily Henderson

[1. True or False. If false, explain why the statement is incorrect. (10 points)]{.underline}\
a. Per the community–epidemiology continuum proposed by Fenton and Pedersen\
(2005), a disease caused by a pathogen with high between-species transmission and no within–target species transmission will be termed a spillover.

False. A disease caused by a pathogen with high between-species transmission and\
no within–target species transmission is an apparent multihost pathogen. The pathogen appears to be multihost because of the high between-species transmission, but the pathogen is not a true multihost pathogen because within–target species transmission is not sustained. A spillover is when a pathogen has low between-species transmission and low within–target species transmission.

\
b. A viral disease that is transmitted to susceptible hosts only by vectors is infectious as well as contagious.

False. Contagious diseases are infectious diseases that spread from person-to-person, so a disease transmitted only by vectors is an infectious disease but not a contagious disease.

\
c. The eggs of Baylisascaris procyonis can be transmitted to humans by direct contact immediately after excretion by an infected raccoon.

False. Baylisascaris procyonis eggs excreted in raccoon feces become infectious around 2-4 weeks after excretion.

\
d. A fungus growing on tall fescue leaves is responsible for decreased feed intake in cattle grazing on this grass, resulting in reduced weight gain and lower milk production.

False. Fungal infection in tall fescue grass does result in reduced weight and lower milk production in cattle grazing on the grass but not because of decreased intake. The fungus that infects tall fescue grass produces ergot alkaloids which are toxic. This toxicity from grazing on infected grass causes symptoms like reduced weight and lower milk production.

\
e. Northern cardinals are considered superspreaders species for West Nile virus.

False. Northern cardinals are considered the supersuppressors species for West Nile virus because cardinals do not produce sufficient viremia to continue the transmission cycle with mosquitoes.

2\. List the community-based interventions used for preventing dracunculiasis transmission in endemic regions. Explain how each intervention interrupts specific stages of the Guinea worm life cycle. How have these strategies evolved in recent years given the emergence of animal (particularly dog) infections? (10 points)

One preventative community-based intervention for dracunculiasis is filtration. Drinking pipes or straws have a filter that prevents the ingestion of water fleas infected with larvae. Simple cloth filters are also another filtration method to filter water fleas. These are the simplest most direct methods. Another preventative measure is building boreholes and protected wells with clean drinking water. Safe water sources allow communities to stop relying on stagnant surface water that contains water fleas and larvae. Treating surface water is also an option to target larvae. A big community-based intervention used is health education for behavior change. This includes avoidance of contaminated water, safe disposal of fish entrails, and discouraging bathing of infected persons/animals in communal water.

Education also teaches people about the risk to animals with the emergence of animal infections, specifically dogs. People are taught to possibly tether dogs, to not allow infected dogs to bath in communal water, and to not feed entrails to dogs. Treating drinking water also works for animals, so small water bodies that are known sources of water for dogs may also be treated.

3\. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an emerging prion disease of cervids and one of the most significant wildlife conservation challenges in North America. What are the main obstacles wildlife agencies face in managing and controlling CWD? (10 points)

There are various challenges to managing and controlling CWD. Surveillance and early detection of the disease is very difficult because CWD has a long incubation period (\>16 months). This makes identifying an outbreak, assessing the spread, and controlling the disease difficult. CWD is a prion disease, and prions persist in the environment. This makes controlling the spread of disease difficult and virtually makes it impossible to "get rid of" the disease once it has been established. Since CWD is a prion disease, there is also no vaccine or treatment because prion diseases are largely still a mystery. CWD is a wildlife disease where management faces a lot of resistance due to political disagreement. Deer hunting in the U.S. is a very big industry with a lot of money at stake. Within that industry there are also fenced deer enclosures that make managing and controlling the disease more difficult because of mixing with wildlife populations (like if a deer escapes) and the amplified spread given larger population densities. Deer are also a species with a large population and wide habitat scope where addressing every member of the population is not possible.

5\. A beaver carcass was found at the Gunnison River Whitewater Park, Gunnison, Colorado in October 2025. Samples collected during the postmortem examination were submitted to the Veterinary Diagnostic Lab. The lab reported that the animal was positive for Tularemia.\

a\. Name the etiological agent of this disease. What subspecies of this agent causes Tularemia in aquatic animals like beavers? (2 points)

Tularemia is caused by Francisella tularensis. F. tularensis subspecies holartica (Type B) causes Tularemia in aquatic animals like beavers.

\
b. What are the different routes of transmission for this agent? (2 points)

There are a few transmission routes for F. tularensis. Humans can get infected with this bacteria through direct contact with an infected animal like a wild rabbit or rodent. F. tularensis can also be transmitted through various vectors. Type A can be transmitted through ticks and flies, and Type B can also be transmitted through mosquitoes. Water may also be contaminated with the bacteria, so a person can get infected from consuming contaminated water. There is also a possibility of aerosolization with the pathogen, so the bacteria can be transmitted through inhalation through air and dust as well.

\
c. Describe key features/characteristics of this pathogen in the context of human health/public health. (3 points)

F. tularensis is a human health threat. The bacteria is highly infectious, can aerosolize, and can be transmitted through multiple vectors. Although humans are dead-end hosts and human-to-human cases have not been reported, humans are still susceptible to this pathogen. Humans can develop various diseases from this pathogen, like oropharyngeal tularemia and skin ulcers. Pathogens with the ability to aerosolize are always pose a threat and concern, but the highly infectious nature of the pathogen also makes the bacteria a viable bioterrorism weapon.

This pathogen can also infect various animals from wild rabbits to rodents, to domestic dogs and cats. The ability to infect multiple host species and transmission through various vectors makes the pathogen a public health threat that is difficult to address with so many transmission routes. The bacteria is a threat to wild animal populations with smaller animals dying in 8 to 14 days in many cases.\

8\. Georgia has a white-tailed deer population of \~ 1 million. A total of 1351 samples from hunter-harvested deer were tested for Chronic Wasting Disease in 2022. None of the samples tested positive for CWD. Using the hypergeometric distribution, Georgia DNR determines that CWD is not present above 0.2% prevalence in Georgia’s white-tailed deer population. You are asked to comment on Georgia DNR’s CWD surveillance approach. In your commentary, explain the downside of using hypergeometric distribution for making decisions about wildlife disease surveillance. (10 points)

The statement is not unreasonable, but the population would have to align with the assumptions of hypergeometric distribution. This means the sample population was sampled randomly, sensitivity is accurate, and there was no strong spatial clustering. These assumptions are the downside to using hypergeometric distribution for management decisions. Given that samples are from hunter-harvested deer, it is unlikely and hard to determine that the sample is completely random (age, sex, geography, etc.), sensitivty was accurate (no test is 100% or room for human error), or that there was no significant spatial clustering. No significant spatial clustering is unlikely given the nature of the disease. As a prion disease, a major route of transmission is exposure to contaminated soil, an infected carcass, etc. This makes spread more localized to a geographic area, unless say a carcass was transported by humans and disease spread that way.

9\. Place the following diseases in appropriate quadrants in the above figure. Explain your choice of quadrants. (10 points)

1\. SARS-CoV-2 - top left, case 4 of community–epidemiology continuum, potential emerging infectious diease

SARS-CoV-2 is a potential emerging infectious disease because the virus has high within-species transmission but low between-species transmission. Although between-species transmission is low, the high within-species transmission means the virus has the potential to reach epidemic levels, like the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002.

2\. Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome - bottom left, case 1 of community–epidemiology continuum, spillover

Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) is a spillover disease because the virus has low between-species transmission and low within-species transmission. The reservoir for HPS is deer mice or rodents in general. There is low transmission between deer mice and humans, and the virus is not sustained within the human population. HPS is not contagious from human–to-human, and the virus can be fatal. Therefore, the virus is spillover with humans being dead-end hosts.

3\. Langya Henipavirus - bottom left, case 1 of community–epidemiology continuum, spillover

Langya Henipavirus (LayV) is a spillover disease because the virus has low between-species transmission and low within-species transmission. LayV has not had any evidence of human–to-human transmission, so the virus is spillover with humans being dead-end hosts. There has not been additional human cases reported since the 2022 outbreak faded out.

4\. Brucellosis - top right, case 3 of community–epidemiology continuum, true multihost pathogen

Brucellosis is a true multihost pathogen because the pathogen has high between-species transmission and high within-species transmission. Within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), brucellosis is maintained within both bison and elk species and can be transmitted between the two species.

5\. West Nile virus - bottom left, case 1 of community–epidemiology continuum, spillover

In humans, West Nile virus (WNV) is a spillover disease because the virus has low between-species transmission and low within-species transmission. WNV is maintained through a bird-mosquito vector cycle. When an infected mosquito feeds on a human instead of a bird, humans and other mammals get infected and are dead end hosts for the virus because viremia is not sufficient to maintain the transmission cycle.

10\. Anisakiasis is the disease caused by infection with the stomach worm Anisakis simplex. It reaches sexual maturity and reproduces in marine mammals. In the following figure, identify the definitive host, a dead-end host, a paratenic host, and an intermediate host. Explain your answers. (8 points)

Marine animals, like the dolphin in the figure, is the definitive host where the stomach worm Anisakis simplex reaches sexual maturity and reproduces. Eggs get released into the ocean and mature into larvae. Crustaceans, which are the intermediate host, consume the larvae. Marine animals that consume the crustaceans get infected, and the stomach worm is able to mature and reproduce. The cycle repeats. Sometimes a seafish or a cephalopod will consume an infected crustacean instead of a marine animal, and seafishes/cephalopods are paratenic hosts which harbor the parasite alive without the parasite developing further or reproducing. Then, a marine animal with consume the infected seafish or cephalopod, and the cycle will repeat. Occasionally, humans will eat raw or undercooked infected fish and get infected. The larvae cannot develop further or reproduce in humans, so the humans are dead-end hosts. This leads to anisakiasis.

11\. All infected hosts are diseased. Comment using appropriate examples. (3 points)

The statement that all infected hosts are diseased is not a correct statement. An organism might be infected with a bacteria, virus, etc. but not show signs of disease. This is often the case with reservoir hosts. For example, white-footed mice are the reservoirs for Borrelia burgdorferi, and white-footed mice do not show signs of disease with the bacteria. Another example that is slightly different is the Saiga antelope bacteria. Pasteurella multocida is naturally occuring in Saiga antelope, but a harmless bacteria became pathogenic under certain condition temperature and humidity conditions. Reservoir hosts are not the only hosts that do not experience disease when infected. For example, shrews are the reservoir hosts for LayV, but goats and dogs testing positive also did not exhibit any clinical signs from the virus.

12\. Klepac et al. estimated an R0 of 2.5 for the 2002 Phocine Distemper virus epidemic in Dutch harbor seals. Assuming that an effective PDV vaccine is available, what proportion of the seal population should be vaccinated to prevent a future outbreak of PDV? (3 points)

Vc: 1 - (1/R0) = 1 - (1/2.5) = 0.6 = 60% of the population should be vaccinated to prevent a future outbreak of PDV.

13. What are some of the main challenges in managing wildlife diseases? Explain using relevant examples. (6 points)

There are various challenges that come with managing wildlife diseases. Many wildlife diseases are difficult to address because of the population size and habitat scope of hosts. For example, raccoon rabies is a public health concern because the virus can infect multiple host species, including humans. The entire raccoon population cannot be vaccinated through injections nor can the other wildlife species susceptible to infect. Raccoon rabies can be difficult because of the scope of the eastern US raccons inhabit, but habitat can also be a challenge in the remoteness of habitats, like the caves of bats and management of white-nose syndrome.

The disease is managed relatively well in the eastern US with bait vaccines dropped in Appalachia, but there is major public health concern for what could happen if raccoon rabies spreads widely past Appalachia given the various species that can be infected. Although raccoon rabies has a management method, vaccines in general and specifically bait vaccines are often not available for wildlife diseases which is another challenge in addition to the inability to address entire populations or habitat scopes. There are often limited management methods to address wildlife disease whether that is a vaccine or any other management strategies.

Surveillance and detection of wildlife diseases is also difficult. For example, chronic wasting disease (CWD) is specifically difficult to have accurate surveillance and can be difficult to detect because the disease has a longer incubation period (\>16 months).

Wildlife diseases are also difficult to manage because diseases are often not limited to wildlife. Many pathogens have the ability to infect more than one host species, but pathogens also do not differentiate wild and domestic animals. Canine rabies in Africa being transmitted between jackals and dogs is a clear example of how wildlife disease are difficult to manage as wildlife, domestic animals, and humans come into contact more. This also poses a serious threat to the potential for emerging infectious diseases with how pathogens adapt.

CWD is also an example of how politics can be a challenge with managing wildlife diseases. Management of CWD includes human interests through the involvement of hunters and fenced deer facilities. White-tailed deer are key to a large industry, and the implication can be less effective management when balancing stakeholder interests.
