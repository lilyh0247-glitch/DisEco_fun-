The epidemiological triad is a diagram demonstrating the connection between a pathogen, host, and the environment. The basic epidemiological triad is a very simplified version of the interactions that happen between pathogen, host, and environment. There can be several hosts involved or infection of multiple pathogens present or other complex interactions.

1\) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

The sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer at a confidence level of 95% is 59 deer.

2\) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

a\) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

The sample size necessary to detect a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population ("infinite") at a confidence level of 95% is 299.

b\) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

The sample size necessary to detect a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population ("infinite") at a confidence level of 99% is 229.

The sample size required for 2b is smaller than the sample size required for 2a. Since the confidence interval increases, the required sample size for 2b is more than the sample size required for an infinite population at 2% prevalence at 95% confidence but less than the required sample size for 2a. A similar observation can be made for 2a. 2a asks about a 1% prevalence at a lesser confidence level of 95% instead of 99%, so the sample size requirement for 2a is more than the required sample size for 2b but less than the sample size required for 1% prevalence at 99% confidence with an infinite population size.

3\) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\<(less than)\_\_ (\<, =, \>) \_1\_%.

### 10/6/25 (#3)

Jan’s research focused on an elk herd housed in an exclosure. The herd size is 56. Her\
data shows that an outbreak of conjunctivitis started on 10th June 2025. She\
meticulously documented the progress of the outbreak in this herd. Her observations of\
affected elk are as follows:\
![](Downloads/Rstudio/IPtable.png)\
Recovered elk are immune (not susceptible) to conjunctivitis for 6 months. There were\
no infected elk in the herd after 06/16/25. Show your work.

a\) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.

6/12/25: 5/51 = 0.098 cases per elk-day

6/14/25: 2/44 = 0.045 cases per elk-day

6/15/25: 0 cases per elk-day

\
b) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit for prevalence.

6/13/25: 12/56 = 21.4% prevalence of conjunctivitis

6/16/25: 5/56 = 8.9% prevalence of conjunctivitis

\
c) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?

**6/10/25**

Incidence: 1/56 = 0.018

Prevalence: 1/56 = 0.018

**6/11/25**

Incidence: 4/55 = 0.072

Prevalence: 5/56 = 0.089

**6/12/25**

Incidence: 5/51 = 0.098

Prevalence: 10/56 = 0.179

**6/13/25**

Incidence: 2/46 = 0.043

Prevalence: 12/56 = 0.214

**6/14/25**

Incidence: 2/44 = 0.045

Prevalence: 11/56 = 0.196

**6/15/25:**

Incidence: 0 cases per elk-day

Prevalence: 8/56 = 0.142

**6/16/25:**

Incidence: 0 cases per elk-day

Prevalence: 5/56 = 0.089

Prevalence is the same as incidence on 6/10/25.

\
d) On which day is the incidence lowest?

Incidence is the lowest on 6/15/25 and 6/16/25 because there are no new cases of disease recorded among the elk.

### 10/8/25 - Tick Lab

In lab today, we learned the basics for how to identify ticks under a microscope. The first steps of identification involve determining the life-stage and sex of the tick. To determine the life-stage, first, determine the number of legs with 6 legs indicating a larvae stage and with 8 legs indicating a nymph or an adult stage. If the tick has 8 legs, you can determine whether the tick is an adult if there is the presence of a genital hole. To determine the sex, observe the scutum of the tick. A conscutum, which I learned in lab looks sort of shiny, indicates a male tick. An alloscutum indicates a female tick because it means the tick can engorge on a blood meal. I learned from lecture and lab that only female ticks engorge on blood meals.

The next steps of basic tick identification are determining the genus and species. To determine the genus, observe the orientation of the anal groove. The *Ixodes* genus will have an anterior anal groove while other genua will have a posterior anal groove. Lab helped clarify that all the ticks have that half-circle structure under the anal groove which then made the anal groove easier to identify. Next, observe the mouth parts and pattern of the tick to determine the species. Using our key in lab, we determined the final tick we looked at was a lone-star tick.

### Exam Remediation (10/15/25) - Addendum 10/22/25

**Question #1 (Question 9 on the exam) - 10 points total**

1.  **one red infected flamingo infects [one]{.underline} blue susceptible flamingo**

2.  **one red infected flamingo infects [three]{.underline} blue susceptible flamingo**

3.  **one red infected flamingo infects [two]{.underline} blue susceptible flamingo**

4.  **one red infected flamingo [does not infect any]{.underline} blue susceptible flamingo**

**Define R0:** R0 is the average number of susceptible hosts infected by a single case within a fully susceptible population

I calculated R0 by adding the susceptible blue flamingos that were infected (1+3+2+0=6) and dividing it by the number of cases (4), and 6 divided by 4 is 1.5. Given the following scenario with flamingos from Question 9, R0 is 1.5, meaning that one case infects on average 1.5 susceptible individuals. A single case can infect one or two or three (and so on) susceptible individuals like the scenario given. R0 is just the average number of susceptible organisms infected by a single case. In this scenario, the average is 1.5. In the real world, an infected individual will pass on the disease to 1-2 susceptible individuals.

10/22/25 - When R0 is less than 1, on average, each infected individual causes less than one new infection, so a disease will decline naturally within a population. When R0 is equal to 1, an infected individual causes an additional infection/case, so a disease will be sustained within a population at an endemic level. When R0 is greater than 1, one infected individuals causes more than one new infection, so there is a greater risk of a disease causing outbreaks or having epidemic potential.

**Question #2 (Question 7 on the exam)**

A mass mortality event (MME) of Saiga antelope in 2015 was caused by a bacteria that is naturally occurring within the population. Research after the MME found that there was a slightly higher temperature and humidity during the birthing season. The elevated temperature and humidity was found to be present in past MMEs in Saiga antelope within the literature as well. The change in environment along with other factors like stress of birthing are thought to cause the bacteria to become pathogenic and result in thousands of still births.

10/22/25 - We can intervene within the setting environment, the host and the pathogen to minimize factors that may contribute to a mass mortality event or reduce affects of MME. We could set regulations applied to land use or agricultural behaviors to minimize the contact of Saiga antelope with livestock to reduce competition of resources and risk of pathogen exchange/mixing. We could improve implementation and enforcement of poaching. These interventions maintain the general population as well as the female birthing population of the Saiga antelope which allows for greater resilience within a Saiga antelope herd. In a broader conservation context, I would suggest potentially designating and maintaining land for the birthing period of Saiga antelope with well maintained environment to potentially offset the influence of differences of weather/climate. We have discussed the difficulty of wildlife vaccination. However, lab research of the bacteria under conditions which make it pathogenic may allow for development of a vaccine that has long-term immunity where we can gradual vaccination among the Saiga antelope population during months not in the birthing season.

### 10/18/25 (#4)

[**MERS-CoV**]{.underline}\
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is mostly found in camels\
(dromedaries), and direct physical contact with camels can lead to transmission to\
humans. Limited human-to-human transmission can occur after close contact and has\
resulted in health care–associated outbreaks. Human MERS-CoV infection can cause\
severe respiratory illness; approximately 35% of reported MERS cases have died.\
Distribution of confirmed cases of MERS by place of infection and month of onset, April\
2012 – September 2025 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control)

![](Downloads/Rstudio/MERS.png)\
**Which of the following statements about MERS-CoV are correct? (If it is incorrect,\
provide an explanation why the statement is incorrect.)**

\
[1. MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations. (2 points)]{.underline}

False. MERS-CoV is primarily maintained within the reservoir host species of camels, but humans can be infected with the virus and transmit the virus to other susceptible humans.

[2. Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV. (2 points)]{.underline}

True. MERS-CoV is a coronavirus that circulates mainly in the Middle East within camels, although the virus can infect humans as well.

[3. Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV. (2 points)]{.underline}

False. MERS-CoV can infect humans, but the virus can only complete short infection chains. The pathogen can invade the target population (in this case humans) but cannot persist.

[4. The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately\
65%. (2 points)]{.underline}

False. Although the case fatality rate for MERS-CoV may be higher due to lack of report or other reasons, only approximately 35% of human MERS cases have died due to the disease.

[5. The epidemic curve indicates this is a point source outbreak. (2 points)]{.underline}

False. If the epidemic curve indicated a point source outbreak, the curve would show one peak indicating an influx of cases due to a single exposure event, but the cases would steadily drop after the initial exposure/influx of cases. Here we see a propagated source where animals are infecting humans and some humans are infecting other humans, although cases do decrease significantly in this epidemic curve after 2020.

### 10/29/25 (#5)

[Marburg Virus Outbreak, Rwanda 2024]{.underline}\
The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda\
probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit\
bats that are known reservoir of Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases of\
Marburg virus infection were documented, and most of the people infected were health\
care workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units.\
**1. Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen, would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging infectious disease? Justify your classification.**

I would classify this Marburg virus outbreak as an emerging infectious disease. The between-species transmission is relatively low given incidental contact with the reservoir bats. However, the within-species transmission within humans is relatively high between healthcare workers or others within exposed settings. This dynamic fits the potential emerging infectious disease (case 4) description from the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen. Given the transmission between humans, the outbreak is not just spillover. A spillover event usually has humans as a deadend host with the disease not being able to sustain long-term outside of the reservoir host species.\
**2. What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings?**

In order to protect the community, isolation needs to be mandatory for known Marburg cases. There might also be isolation for highly probable suspected cases. Isolation does put healthcare workers and possibly other patients within related facilities at risk of exposure and infection. This exposure and infection can be mitigated by having strict personal protective equipment (PPE) standards, negative pressure rooming (if resources allow) and strict disinfection and sterilization standards. Some other simultaneous measures to reduce risk could be safe waste management, safe burial and body management, and caving restrictions or certification.

### 11/14/15 (#7)

[**Nipah Virus**]{.underline}\
Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission\
in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how the modes of transmission differ\
between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventive\
measures recommended in each setting. (8 points)

Nipah virus ecology varies across Southeast and South Asia. For example, Nipah virus is mainly transmitted through pig bridge hosts in Malaysia. Pigs will get Nipah virus from bats or fruit contaminated with bat excretions, and humans mainly get the virus from infected pigs in Malaysia. However, humans often get infected with Nipah virus through contaminated date palm sap in Bangladesh. Buckets collecting sap will become contaminated with bat excretions, and humans become infected from consuming raw sap.

These differences in transmission call for different preventative measures. Since most of the cases in Malaysia are from contact with infected pigs, early detection and surveillance of the disease is a possible preventative measure that is plausible with the route of transmission observed. In Bangladesh, there are a few more preventative options. Many infections come from consuming raw sap, so heating/cooking the sap prior to consumption is a precautionary action in addition to just avoiding raw date palm sap. There are also some covers or lids being used with some sap collection which prevents bat excretions from entering the sap during collection.

\
[**Avian Reovirus**]{.underline}\
Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the\
different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its\
transmission. What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes?\
Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly describe\
its impact on the affected population. (6 points)

Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted horizontally through fecal-oral transmission or vertically from the mother. Most cases are thought to be a result from fecal-oral transmission often as a consequence of vertical transmission. For example, a congenitally infected chick spreads the disease within a flock through the fecal-oral route. Fecal-oral transmission is enabled by poor hygiene, overcrowding, and poor ventilation. The pathogen itself is also resilient and persistent for weeks within the environment or on surfaces which further supports fecal-oral transmission.

ARV causes arthritis and tenosynovitis (swollen tendon) in commercial chickens and wild birds. These diseases cause lameness and swollen joints. In wild bird populations, these illnesses caused by ARV decrease the ability to or prevent escape from predators or foraging for food. Predation on sick wild birds can result in death, but illness in commercial chickens can also result in death based on decisions of product value and treatment costs.

\
[**Langya henipavirus**]{.underline}\
Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China.\
Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV\
classified as a spillover and not a potential EID? (6 points)

Based on some surveillance testing of wildlife within the Shandong and Henan provinces where cases were observed, the likely reservoir for LayV is shrews. Most of the cases were farmers or had frequent wildlife exposure, and shrews are widely present in these rural areas in China. LayV is thought to be transmitted through direct or indirect contact with shrews and their bodily fluids.

LayV is not classified as a potential emerging infectious (EID) disease because the virus does not have confirmed human-to-human transmission. A potential EID has the ability to infect another species, namely humans, and sustain infection within that population/humans. There have not been additional cases since the outbreak from 2018-2022. LayV is a spillover because the disease can infect other species (humans) besides the reservoir species, but the virus has not proven to sustain itself within the other species. (see Fenton and Pedersen community epidemiology framework)

### 11/18/25 (#8)

Overall, there is a significant difference between prevalence of raccoon roundworm in the three regions. When analyzed comparatively in pairs, there is a significant difference in the prevalence between the central region and north region (p-value=0.0256) as well as the central region and south region (p-value=0.0015), but there is not a significant difference just comparing the north and south (p-value=1). Regional differences suggest that there could be regional variation of raccoon density or environmental prescence and persistence of raccoon roundworm eggs. The central and south regions may have more or better established raccoon latrines.

When comparing sex of the raccoons, there was a significant difference between the prevalence of raccoon roundworm in females compared to males (p-value=0.0087). When comparing males and females in each region, the prevalence within females was only significant in the south region (p-value=0.0030); however, the data is potentially suggestive of a difference between females and males in the central region with a p-value of 0.0859. Greater prevalence within females may suggest social or reproductive behavioral differences that put females in greater contact with contaminated environments or raccoon latrines. There may also be physiological factors at play like reproductive stress.

There was not a significant difference for prevalence of raccoon roundworm in adults compared to young adults (p-value=0.2206). Also, there was no significant difference observed for the prevalence of raccoon roundworm between age classes within each region. The regional and sexual differences observed call for more research into the ecological, population, and geographic differences that may be driving these differences. The south region may need the most immediate attention because the region seems to pose the most environmental risk to children, domestic animals, and other wildlife based on the data.
