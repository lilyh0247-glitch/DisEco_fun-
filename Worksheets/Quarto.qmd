```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")

The epidemiological triad is a diagram demonstrating the connection between a pathogen, host, and the environment. The basic epidemiological triad is a very simplified version of the interactions that happen between pathogen, host, and environment. There can be several hosts involved or infection of multiple pathogens present or other complex interactions.
