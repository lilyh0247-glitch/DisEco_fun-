## **8/29/25 (#1)**

Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: ¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

The epidemiological triad is a diagram demonstrating the connection between a pathogen, host, and the environment. The basic epidemiological triad is a very simplified version of the interactions that happen between pathogen, host, and environment. There can be several hosts involved or infection of multiple pathogens present or other complex interactions.

1\) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

The sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer at a confidence level of 95% is 59 deer.

2\) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

a\) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

The sample size necessary to detect a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population ("infinite") at a confidence level of 95% is 299.

b\) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

The sample size necessary to detect a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population ("infinite") at a confidence level of 99% is 229.

The sample size required for 2b is smaller than the sample size required for 2a. Since the confidence interval increases, the required sample size for 2b is more than the sample size required for an infinite population at 2% prevalence at 95% confidence but less than the required sample size for 2a. A similar observation can be made for 2a. 2a asks about a 1% prevalence at a lesser confidence level of 95% instead of 99%, so the sample size requirement for 2a is more than the required sample size for 2b but less than the sample size required for 1% prevalence at 99% confidence with an infinite population size.

3\) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\<(less than)\_\_ (\<, =, \>) \_1\_%.

### 10//25 (#3)

Jan’s research focused on an elk herd housed in an exclosure. The herd size is 56. Her\
data shows that an outbreak of conjunctivitis started on 10th June 2025. She\
meticulously documented the progress of the outbreak in this herd. Her observations of\
affected elk are as follows:\
![](Downloads/Rstudio/IPtable.png)\
Recovered elk are immune (not susceptible) to conjunctivitis for 6 months. There were\
no infected elk in the herd after 06/16/25. Show your work.

a\) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.

6/12/25: 5/51 = 0.098 cases per elk-day

6/14/25: 2/44 = 0.045 cases per elk-day

6/15/25: 0 cases per elk-day

\
b) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit for prevalence.

6/13/25: 12/56 = 21.4% prevalence of conjunctivitis

6/16/25: 5/56 = 8.9% prevalence of conjunctivitis

\
c) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?

**6/10/25**

Incidence: 1/56 = 0.018

Prevalence: 1/56 = 0.018

**6/11/25**

Incidence: 4/55 = 0.072

Prevalence: 5/56 = 0.089

**6/12/25**

Incidence: 5/51 = 0.098

Prevalence: 10/56 = 0.179

**6/13/25**

Incidence: 2/46 = 0.043

Prevalence: 12/56 = 0.214

**6/14/25**

Incidence: 2/44 = 0.045

Prevalence: 11/56 = 0.196

**6/15/25:**

Incidence: 0 cases per elk-day

Prevalence: 8/56 = 0.142

**6/16/25:**

Incidence: 0 cases per elk-day

Prevalence: 5/56 = 0.089

Prevalence is the same as incidence on 6/10/25.

\
d) On which day is the incidence lowest?

Incidence is the lowest on 6/15/25 and 6/16/25 because there are no new cases of disease recorded among the elk.

### 10/8/25 - Tick Lab

In lab today, we learned the basics for how to identify ticks under a microscope. The first steps of identification involve determining the life-stage and sex of the tick. To determine the life-stage, first, determine the number of legs with 6 legs indicating a larvae stage and with 8 legs indicating a nymph or an adult stage. If the tick has 8 legs, you can determine whether the tick is an adult if there is the presence of a genital hole. To determine the sex, observe the scutum of the tick. A conscutum, which I learned in lab looks sort of shiny, indicates a male tick. An alloscutum indicates a female tick because it means the tick can engorge on a blood meal. I learned from lecture and lab that only female ticks engorge on blood meals.

The next steps of basic tick identification are determining the genus and species. To determine the genus, observe the orientation of the anal groove. The *Ixodes* genus will have an anterior anal groove while other genua will have a posterior anal groove. Lab helped clarify that all the ticks have that half-circle structure under the anal groove which then made the anal groove easier to identify. Next, observe the mouth parts and pattern of the tick to determine the species. Using our key in lab, we determined the final tick we looked at was a lone-star tick.

### Exam Remediation (10/15/25)

**Question #1 (Question 9 on the exam)**

1.  **one red infected flamingo infects [one]{.underline} blue susceptible flamingo**

2.  **one red infected flamingo infects [three]{.underline} blue susceptible flamingo**

3.  **one red infected flamingo infects [two]{.underline} blue susceptible flamingo**

4.  **one red infected flamingo [does not infect any]{.underline} blue susceptible flamingo**

**Define R0:** R0 is the average number of susceptible hosts infected by a single case within a fully susceptible population

I calculated R0 by adding the susceptible blue flamingos that were infected (1+3+2+0=6) and dividing it by the number of cases (4), and 6 divided by 4 is 1.5. Given the following scenario with flamingos from Question 9, R0 is 1.5, meaning that one case infects on average 1.5 susceptible individuals. In the real world, a single case can infect one or two or three (and so on) susceptible individuals like the scenario given. R0 is just the average number of susceptible organisms infected by a single case. In this scenario, the average is 1.5. In the real world, an infected individual will pass on the disease to 1-2 susceptible individuals.

**Question #2 (Question 7 on the exam)**

A mass mortality event (MME) of Saiga antelope in 2015 was caused by a bacteria that is naturally occurring within the population. Research after the MME found that there was a slightly higher temperature and humidity during the birthing season. The elevated temperature and humidity was found to be present in past MMEs in Saiga antelope within the literature as well. The change in environment along with other factors like stress of birthing are thought to cause the bacteria to become pathogenic and result in thousands of still births.

In this case specifically, we cannot intervene on weather and climate within the environmental component of the epidemiological triad. We can intervene within the setting environment or the host and the pathogen to minimize factors that may contribute to a mass mortality event. We could monitor the environment and pathogens within the population to aniticipate abnormalities within the birthing setting of Saiga antelope (surveillance) and minimize the contact of Saiga antelope with livestock or other stressors. In a broader conservation context, I would suggest potentially designating and maintaining land for the birthing period of Saiga antelope with well maintained environment to potentially offset the influence of differences of weather/climate.
